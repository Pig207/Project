    '''At first this problem really confused me, but I realised that if I think of horizontal, verticle, and diagonal patterns
    in the grid as position changes then it would be a lot easier. For example, straight horizontal lines move 1 every time, 
    horizontal move 20 (moving to a new line), diagonal down to the left is 19 (moving down a line but minus 1), and
    diagonal down to the right is 21 (moving down a line plus 1).
